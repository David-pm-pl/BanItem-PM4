BanItem is a PocketMine plugin designed to ban items on a server-wide basis.

This is fork of LDX's BanItem plugin: the original code was preserved, and the following added:
 
Logs information to Console for any players trying to use banned items, and where it happened.

Report use of banned items to staff in the game

Log items being banned/unbanned.

### Commands

All commands default to OP only:

```
/banitem add 57 - ban diamond block
/banitem unban 57 - unban diamond block
/banitem list - list all banned blocks
/banitem report - toggles in-game banned item reporting
```
